Dealing with data and settings is a bit hard when it comes to an applications
with a lot of performance choices. The SettingView is an abstraction to
automate the UI generating, data saving and data loading. And combining
it with `cufy.beans` and `cufy.io.loadable` will make it more and more easier
to deal with data in any android application locally and from the internet.
